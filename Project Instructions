To be able to run MEE.py, you will need to make sure you have everything that's in the Final project zip file in the same folder
(excluding the images).

You also need to make sure you have all of the following libraries installed on Python 3+ (I recommend using Anaconda):

- Keras (with Tensorflow backend)
- OpenCV
- PIL
- Numpy

The next few should be default, but just in case, I'll mention them:

- OS
- Tkinter
- Random

With these requirements knocked off, you should be able to run MEE.py
